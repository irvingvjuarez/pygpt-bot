# pygpt-bot
Chatbot using OpenAI python library.
Repo inspired from OpenAI course on [Propmt Engineering](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/).

# Getting started
Remember this repo uses python. Hence, the process to setup the code has to be accordingly.

In order to run this repo on your local machine follow these steps:
- Fork this repo
- Clone it into your local machine
- Create a virtual environment (for dowloading purposes)
- Activate that virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Get a api key from https://openai.com/product
- Run the code: `OPENAI_API_KEY="[your api key]" python3 main.py`

Everytime you run the python code, you must include the api as env variable. I recommend you to create a .env file where you can store it and pick it up when needed.
